## Feedback Review

### The Good/The Most Helpful
- Whiteboarding practice with your peers
  - "scary but helpful" ~perfect!
- Interactive pieces of lecture
  - awesome, I will continue!

### The Bad/The Least Helpful
- People find me condescending, and are reluctant to ask questions.
  - This hit hard. I don't want this to be true.
  - On questions about the content we're covering, I want this to NEVER be the case.
  - There are some questions I don't want to take the time to answer in class, but I'm failing to show empathy in those moments. I will do better.
  - It seems like there are a few pieces to this:
    - Sometimes, people have questions about content we will cover in the future. Given our limited amount of lecture time each day, I'm going to continue to give quick answers to these questions, and I'll try to specify which days we will hit future content.
    - Sometimes, people have questions about content that isn't part of the course, and that isn't helpful to most people's understanding. I'm generally willing to answer such questions, but depending on timing during lecture, I may have more or less time to answer these. If you want to know more about advanced topics, I'm willing to discuss those things after lecture, after people have gotten the necessary content for that day.
    - Sometimes, people have questions that are criticism about what we're learning or how we're learning. I am generally happy to have conversations about such things outside of lecture, and I'll try to give answers during lecture, but I don't find it to generally be a good use of our time in lecture.
- We're moving fast
  - That's intentional--we have a lot to cover!
  - It's OK not to understand all of how Java works yet. More discussion is coming this week, and some pieces of Java we won't cover at all.


## Warmup Questions

1. What is inheritance?
2. What does it mean for one class to inherit from another class?
3. What are interfaces? What's the difference between a base class and an interface?
4. What was the relationship between our `LinkedList` class and our `Node` class?
