## Feedback Review

### The Good/The Most Helpful

- Most common comment on the last week was "it was hard but I learned a lot and made it through"
    - this is AMAZING. You're showing the grit that will help you continue succeeding.
- Friday's CCW helped you "appreciate your classmates"
    - <3
- Whiteboard practice on Thursday morning
    - Agreed! Let's keep doing this...
    - but this week all the classrooms are full in the mornings.
    - so let's do this from 1pm-2pm tomorrow in Hopper!
- Code challenges, labs, lecture demos, drawings in lecture

### The Bad/The Least Helpful
- Spring gets mixed reviews... it's a "verbose" and "slow" MVC framework
    - yep. It's generally regarded as the old-but-good MVC framework; appx 40% market share.
    - Definitely a steep learning curve, so keep reaching out when things go wrong!
- Request for more comments in demo code
    - Thanks for the feedback! I'll do my best!
- Some facilities stuff (chairs, temperature, whiteboards)
    - Passed along to the relevant parties.
