2. What is a method, in HTTP?
3. What is a route?
4. What is the job of a server?

## Learning Objectives
* Students will be able to configure a Java project with Spring dependencies.
* Students will be able to start a local server that serves static content.
* Students will be able to write controllers with routes that carry in information via URL parameters.
* Students will be able to deploy their Spring server to Heroku and access it.

## Lecture Outline
* Run a simple Spring server locally.
* Return simple string responses.
* Serve static content.
* Configure a route with URL parameters.

## Feedback Review

### The Good/The Most Helpful

- People are feeling a turnaround from me: I care about you!
    - I'm SO GLAD. This is incredibly important to me.
    - Please keep letting me know if you feel anything other than support from me.
- Demo time with pictures
    - hooray!
    - The high level will continue to be important forever.
- Systems talks
- Whiteboarding/interview practice
    - Y'all seem to be doing a better job than usual of giving helpful, constructive feedback on Thursdays, which is AWESOME. Keep it up.


### The Mixed

- Some people felt like last week had "more realistic goals and objectives", while others feel like we're "moving on before I have a firm grasp on the material".
    - There are many parts of OOP that might continue to feel iffy for a long time, and that's OK. It's hard to understand (e.g) why interfaces are such a good idea until you've seen them in practice a dozen times.
    - With Spring this week, there will be even more rabbitholes-not-worth-going-down. You're learning to be comfortable with that feeling.
- Lots of people really like code review, but also some constructive feedback:
    - Annoyance at spending another hour on the same thing that's been the focus of the morning
        - Shows up mostly from people with more experience, and I'm okay with that
    - Wanting more examples of "good" code, not just "student" code
        - We'll keep doing a mix of this, but I'll try to tip the mix more towards "good"
        - While reviewing your peers' code, I'll continue to point out the differences between that code and how I would have implemented something
    - People appreciate talking about many possible solutions to code challenges specifically
        - cool! will continue!

### The Bad/The Least Helpful

- Afternoon lecture
    - I try to make lecture interactive specifically to help with this
    - Some other things that have helped some people:
        - Standing for part of lecture
        - Going outside during break
